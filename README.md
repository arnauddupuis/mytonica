# Mytonica
Mytonica is a game developped for the #olcCodeJam2020.

## Pitch

The game places you in the shoes of a creator. A creator of the greatest machine of all time: life!

Your goal, is the goal of life itself: harvest, grow, reproduce and get more and more complex.

But on top of this simingly simple goal, there is a twist: you need harmony and balance in your creation. The game is not won by scoring points or defeating an ennemy, the game is won when you develop a living colony that produce great symphonies!
