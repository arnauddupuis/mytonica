## Theme

The theme for this code jam is "The great Machine".

## Pitch

The game places you in the shoes of a creator. A creator of the greatest machine of all time: life!

Your goal, is the goal of life itself: build life forms, harvest, grow, reproduce and get more and more complex.

But on top of this seemingly simple goal, there is a twist: you need harmony and balance in your creation. The game is not won by scoring points or defeating an enemy, the game is won when you develop a living, viable colony that produce great symphonies! Each building block has a unique sound signature that is played when a cell is active.
Oh and colors are important too!

## Install / Run

You need to install the dependencies, but you don't need to install Mytonica, you can run it from the source directory.

To install the dependencies just run:  
```bash
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Or if you prefer to use a virtual environment:  
```bash
python3 -mvenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate (or execute activate.bat on windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the simulation:  
```bash
python3 mytonica.py
```

## How to play

Mytonica is a life simulation, your goal is to gather genetic material to increase diversity.


As the Main Loop Controller, you configure or encode the genetic algorithm by using base cells. When you run the simulation the cells are going to move around, reproduce, evolve and die. Your goal is to collect all the genetic material with as little cells as possible. 

New genetic material gives you access to new cells. New... not necessarily better...

Cells have a lifespan, a note and a chord (I had to remove the sound for the jam but I'll fix it) and can move around in the following directions:

 * UP
 * DOWN
 * LEFT
 * RIGHT
 * DRUP (Diagonal Right UP)
 * DRDOWN (Diagonal Right DOWN)
 * DLUP (Diagonal Left UP)
 * DLDOWN (Diagonal Left DOWN)

At every turn, they will have an opportunity to select the best cell around to reproduce. Cells have an automatic incentive to go toward the closest genetic material (or else they don't reproduce and dies).

Controls

 * TAB: navigate between the pads
 * Arrow keys: navigate within the pads and move the cursor in the encoding pad
 * ENTER: select stuff in the cell pool pad and commands pad (and automatically return to the encoding pad).
 * SPACE: in the encoding pad, place a cell.

Note: The soundtrack was supposed to be generated by the cellular automata but catastrophic performances and lack of time got me to remove it altogether.
