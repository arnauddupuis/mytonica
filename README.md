# Mytonica
Mytonica is a game developed for the #olcCodeJam2020.

## Pitch

The game places you in the shoes of a creator. A creator of the greatest machine of all time: life!

Your goal, is the goal of life itself: build life forms, harvest, grow, reproduce and get more and more complex.

But on top of this seemingly simple goal, there is a twist: you need harmony and balance in your creation. The game is not won by scoring points or defeating an enemy, the game is won when you develop a living, viable colony that produce great symphonies! Each building block has a unique sound signature that is played when a cell is active.
